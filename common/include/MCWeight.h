/** \brief Set the event weight according to the sample lumi and a target lumi
 *
 * This module only has an effect if "use_sframe_weight" is set to "false" to avoid
 * applying the same weight twice. Also, it will only run, if "dataset_type"
 * equals "MC".
 *
 * Interprets the following settings from the passed Context:
 *  - "dataset_lumi": the lumi of the current dataset, in inverse pb
 *  - "target_lumi": the data lumi to reweight to, in inverse pb
 * These are set automatically if running via SFrame by AnalysisModuleRunner.
 * 
 * The event weight is multiplied with the ratio of dataset_lumi and target_lumi, independent
 * of the maximum number of processed events. This is different from sframe which
 * takes into account the number of events to process.

# UHH2 framework

This framework is for data analysis in the UHH group for the 13TeV era.
It replaces the `UHHAnalysis` code (see https://github.com/UHHAnalysis/) and
uses the same ntuple format. Please refer to the https://github.com/UHH2/UHH2/wiki for more information.
=======
VLQToTopAndLepton
=================
This should be the repository for an analysis which has a Top and a Lepton in the final state.
The physics is happening for a vector like quark B' -> tW, which can be produced in association with
a b or a top.
